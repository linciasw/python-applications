## LOAN PAYMENT FORMULA
#
#             P × r × (1 + r)^n
# PMT = -----------------------------
#                 (1 + r)^n - 1
#
# Key:
# PMT = monthly loan payment
# P   = principal (original loan amount)
# r   = monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
# n   = total number of payments (years × 12)
#
# Example:
# P = 50,000
# Annual interest rate = 6.5% = 0.065
# r = 0.065 / 12
# n = 5 × 12 = 60
#
# The formula calculates the fixed monthly payment
# required to pay off the loan over the specified term.



# LOOP KEYWORDS
# pass: A do-nothing placeholder used when code is required by syntax rules, 
# but you want no action taken. 
# It lets the normal flow of code continue downward.

# continue: Stops the current loop run right away and jumps back to the top to 
# evaluate the while condition for the next round.

# break: Exits the loop entirely and moves on to the code right below the loop block.
