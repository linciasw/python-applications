# Suggested Functions

You don't have to use these, but they are good practice:

```python
display_menu()

create_trip()

add_expense()

view_expenses()

calculate_total_spending()

calculate_remaining_budget()

view_category_summary()

validate_amount()
```

---

# Suggested Data Structure

You can store trip information using variables:

```python
destination = ""
days = 0
budget = 0
```

Expenses can be stored using a list:

```python
expenses = [
    {
        "category": "Food",
        "description": "Dinner",
        "amount": 65
    }
]
```
