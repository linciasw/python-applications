# Vacation Expense Tracker

A personal vacation budgeting and expense-tracking application that allows users to plan a trip financially, record expenses as they occur, and analyze their spending afterward.

---

# 1. Project Goal

Build a simple application that answers three questions:

1. **How much can I afford to spend?**
2. **How much have I actually spent?**
3. **Where did my money go?**

The application should work somewhat like a lightweight spreadsheet, while adding automatic calculations and analysis.

---

# 2. Core Features

The application should have three main stages:

```text
PLAN → TRACK → ANALYZE
```

### Plan

Create a budget before the trip.

### Track

Enter, edit, delete, and view expenses during the trip.

### Analyze

Compare the actual spending against the original budget.

---

# 3. Trip Information

The user should be able to create a trip containing:

* Trip name
* Destination
* Start date
* End date
* Number of travelers
* Total trip budget
* Currency

Example:

```text
Trip Name: New York Vacation
Destination: New York
Start Date: 2026-09-17
End Date: 2026-09-25
Travelers: 1
Total Budget: $3,000 USD
```

---

# 4. Budget Planning

Before recording expenses, the user should be able to create a planned budget.

## Budget Categories

Initial categories:

* Flight
* Accommodation
* Food
* Activities
* Transportation
* eSIM / Internet
* Shopping
* Other

The user should be able to assign a budget to each category.

Example:

| Category       |     Budget |
| -------------- | ---------: |
| Flight         |       $500 |
| Accommodation  |       $900 |
| Food           |       $800 |
| Activities     |       $300 |
| Transportation |       $200 |
| eSIM           |        $50 |
| Shopping       |       $150 |
| Other          |       $100 |
| **Total**      | **$3,000** |

---

# 5. Expense Tracking

The user should be able to add individual expenses.

Each expense should contain:

* Expense ID
* Date
* Description
* Category
* Amount
* Currency
* Optional notes

Example:

```text
Expense ID: 001
Date: 2026-09-18
Description: Dinner at restaurant
Category: Food
Amount: $45
Currency: USD
Notes: Dinner after Broadway show
```

---

# 6. Expense Management

The application should support basic CRUD functionality.

## Create

Add a new expense.

## Read

View existing expenses.

## Update

Edit an existing expense.

## Delete

Delete an expense.

The user should be able to view expenses in a table-like format.

Example:

| ID  | Date   | Description | Category       | Amount |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- | -----: |
| 001 | Sep 18 | Dinner      | Food           |    $45 |
| 002 | Sep 19 | Subway      | Transportation |  $2.90 |
| 003 | Sep 19 | Museum      | Activities     |    $30 |

---

# 7. Expense Filtering

The user should be able to filter expenses by:

* Category
* Date
* Date range
* Amount
* Description

Example:

```text
Show all Food expenses.

Show expenses between September 18 and September 21.

Show expenses greater than $50.
```

---

# 8. Budget vs Actual Spending

The application should compare the original budget with actual spending.

Example:

| Category      | Budget | Actual | Remaining | Status    |
| ------------- | -----: | -----: | --------: | --------- |
| Flight        |   $500 |   $480 |       $20 | Under     |
| Accommodation |   $900 |   $900 |        $0 | On Budget |
| Food          |   $800 |   $925 |     -$125 | Over      |
| Activities    |   $300 |   $250 |       $50 | Under     |

The application should calculate:

```text
Remaining = Budget - Actual
```

---

# 9. Overall Spending Summary

The application should display:

* Total budget
* Total spent
* Remaining budget
* Percentage of budget spent
* Number of expenses
* Average expense

Example:

```text
Total Budget:       $3,000
Total Spent:        $2,455
Remaining:          $545
Budget Used:        81.8%
Number of Expenses: 37
Average Expense:    $66.35
```

---

# 10. Spending Analysis

After expenses have been entered, the application should provide an analysis of spending.

## Category Analysis

Show how much was spent in each category.

Example:

```text
Food             $925
Accommodation    $900
Activities       $250
Transportation   $180
Shopping         $120
Other             $80
```

---

# 11. Budget Performance

Identify categories where spending was:

* Under budget
* On budget
* Over budget

The application should highlight categories that significantly exceed their budget.

Example:

```text
Food
Budget: $800
Actual: $925
Over Budget: $125
```

---

# 12. Spending Percentages

Calculate what percentage of total spending belongs to each category.

Example:

```text
Food:             37.7%
Accommodation:    36.7%
Activities:       10.2%
Transportation:    7.3%
Shopping:          4.9%
Other:             3.2%
```

This should help the user understand where most of their money went.

---

# 13. Daily Spending Analysis

The application should calculate spending by day.

Example:

| Date   | Total Spent |
| ------ | ----------: |
| Sep 18 |        $120 |
| Sep 19 |         $85 |
| Sep 20 |        $210 |
| Sep 21 |         $95 |

The application should identify:

* Highest-spending day
* Lowest-spending day
* Average daily spending

---

# 14. Analysis Insights

The application should eventually generate simple observations based on the data.

Examples:

```text
You spent 15% more on food than your budget.

Food was your largest spending category.

You spent the most money on September 20.

You have $545 remaining from your original budget.
```

Keep these insights simple initially.

---

# 15. Data Model

The application should use a structure similar to:

```python
trip = {
    "name": "",
    "destination": "",
    "start_date": "",
    "end_date": "",
    "travelers": 1,
    "currency": "",
    "total_budget": 0,
    "budget": {},
    "expenses": []
}
```

Budget:

```python
budget = {
    "flight": 0,
    "accommodation": 0,
    "food": 0,
    "activities": 0,
    "transportation": 0,
    "esim": 0,
    "shopping": 0,
    "other": 0
}
```

Expense:

```python
expense = {
    "id": 1,
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "category": "",
    "amount": 0,
    "currency": "",
    "notes": ""
}
```

---

# 16. Data Persistence

Expenses and trip information should not disappear when the application closes.

The first version should use a simple local storage solution.

Possible options:

1. JSON
2. CSV
3. SQLite

### Recommended progression

Start with:

```text
Python dictionaries/lists
        ↓
JSON
        ↓
SQLite
        ↓
Web application database
```

SQLite should eventually become the preferred solution once the application becomes more sophisticated.

---

# 17. User Interface Progression

The project should be developed progressively.

## Version 1 — Command Line

Create the core functionality using Python.

Features:

* Create trip
* Set budget
* Add expense
* View expenses
* Edit expense
* Delete expense
* Calculate totals
* Compare budget vs actual

---

## Version 2 — Persistent Data

Add JSON or SQLite storage.

The application should retain information after closing.

---

## Version 3 — Streamlit Web App

Convert the application into a web application.

Suggested pages:

```text
Dashboard
Budget
Expenses
Analysis
Settings
```

---

# 18. Dashboard

The dashboard should provide a quick overview.

Example:

```text
NEW YORK VACATION

Budget
$3,000

Spent
$2,455

Remaining
$545

Budget Used
81.8%

----------------------------

Top Spending Categories

Food             $925
Accommodation    $900
Activities       $250

----------------------------

Recent Expenses

Dinner            $45
Museum            $30
Subway             $2.90
```

---

# 19. Expenses Page

The expenses page should behave somewhat like a simple spreadsheet.

Users should be able to:

* View all expenses
* Add expenses
* Edit expenses
* Delete expenses
* Sort expenses
* Filter expenses
* Search expenses

---

# 20. Budget Page

The budget page should allow users to:

* Set the total budget
* Set category budgets
* Edit category budgets
* See allocated vs unallocated money
* Compare budget allocations

The application should warn the user if category budgets exceed the total trip budget.

---

# 21. Analysis Page

The analysis page should contain:

* Total spending
* Category breakdown
* Budget vs actual
* Spending percentages
* Daily spending
* Highest spending category
* Highest spending day
* Budget overruns

Charts can eventually be added using Python visualization libraries.

Possible charts:

* Spending by category
* Budget vs actual
* Spending over time
* Daily spending

---

# 22. Validation

The application should validate user input.

Examples:

### Amount

Must be a valid positive number.

```text
$50       ✓
50.25     ✓
-20       ✗
hello     ✗
```

### Category

Must be one of the available categories.

### Date

Must be a valid date.

### Budget

Cannot be negative.

### Required fields

Trip name, destination, dates, and expense amount should not be empty.

---

# 23. Error Handling

The application should gracefully handle invalid input.

Examples:

```python
try:
    amount = float(input("Amount: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

The user should not have to restart the application because of an invalid input.

---

# 24. Future Features

These should NOT be part of the first version.

Potential future improvements:

* Multiple trips
* Multiple currencies
* Currency conversion
* Receipt uploads
* Receipt image/OCR processing
* Authentication
* Cloud database
* User accounts
* Export to CSV
* Export to Excel
* PDF reports
* Interactive charts
* Mobile-friendly interface
* Shared trips
* Multiple travelers
* Individual spending per traveler
* Automatic exchange-rate retrieval

---

# 25. Project Development Strategy

Build the project in layers rather than trying to create the complete application immediately.

---

# 27. Core Concept

The application should ultimately feel like:

```text
             VACATION EXPENSE TRACKER
                       │
          ┌────────────┴────────────┐
          │                         │
        PLAN                      TRACK
          │                         │
      Set Budget              Add Expenses
          │                         │
          └────────────┬────────────┘
                       │
                    ANALYZE
                       │
          ┌────────────┼────────────┐
          │            │            │
       Budget       Categories     Daily
       vs Actual     Spending     Spending
          │            │            │
          └────────────┼────────────┘
                       │
                   INSIGHTS
```

The main purpose is not simply to record expenses. It is to let the user **plan their money, track what actually happened, and understand the difference afterward**.
