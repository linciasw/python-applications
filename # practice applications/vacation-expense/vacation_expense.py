    How the below for loop works:
    enumerate(categories) pairs each item with an index.
    start=1 makes the numbering begin at 1 instead of Python's default of 0.
    f"{number}. {category}" formats the output nicely.

    Since you're starting to structure programs more cleanly, 
    enumerate() is the standard Pythonic way to print numbered lists. It's something you'll use often.
